# ThirdExam
This is the most fantastic crime reporting app in the world.
To make it work you simply:
1) POST a crime. You get to choose the officer who will be assigned to this crime.
2) The crime is sent to the enforcement database and automatically assigned to the chosen officer.
3) As an enforcement unit, you can then PATCH the crime to change status or assigned officer.
4) Upon updating the crime by enforcement unit, an email is sent to the reporting party and an update is sent synchronously back to the crime database.
5) As a crime reporter you can also delete crimes and update them.
Pagination, sorting and filtration are implemented.
